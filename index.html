<p id="rcorners2">I obtained my Bachelor's of Science degree in Sociology (with a minor in Psychology).
At the time of graduating, I was interested in going into the Social Service / NonProfit route.
I have always been super interested in tech, but always thought that it was "too difficult" to
do as a full time career.</p>

<h2 id="B1">Early Career</h2>
 <article>
 <p id="rcorners2">My first full-time job out of college was as a Social Worker for a third party organization
that worked with the Department of Family Services. I stayed there for 9 months, where my husband
and I moved back to St Louis. When we relocated, I got a position as a Teaching Assistant
at an elementary school. I really enjoyed helping people, but I liked the aspect
of working 1:1 with children.</p>

<h2 id="C1">Learning More</h2>
 <article>
 <p id="rcorners2">March 2018, I realized I was very interested in transitioning careers.
I began by taking some online courses online, such as SQL, data analysis, 
and Python. Those types of courses really peaked my interests. Right then and there,
I KNEW I wanted to have a career in programming. Over those next few months,
I spent a lot of my free time learning and taking different online courses.
Unfortunately, without a computer science degree, I was not sure how I 
would take this knowledge and find a career with it.</p>

<h2 id="D1">Launchcode &amp; Beyond</h2>
 <article>
 <p id="rcorners2">I found out about Launchcode early into Fall and thought it was such a cool program.
Once applications opened, I applied. I was so ready and excited,
but unfortunately the application window was open for almost two months
before accepting any applications. Once I got accepted, I was SO THRILLED.
It was such an exciting step and moment in my life that I knew I was where I needed to be.
Launchcode not only opens so many doors for people, it also brings in such a great 
community of individuals togethers. It gives such an opportunity that
others might not feel was possible before.</p>
